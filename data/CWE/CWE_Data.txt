272	Least Privilege Violation	Base	The elevated privilege level required to perform operations such as chroot() should be dropped immediately after the operation is performed.	{'ChildOf': ['271'], 'ParentOf': []}	https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/272.html
688	Function Call With Incorrect Variable or Reference as Argument	Variant	The software calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies the wrong variable or reference as one of the arguments, which may lead to undefined behavior and resultant weaknesses.	{'ChildOf': ['628'], 'ParentOf': []}	https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/688.html
