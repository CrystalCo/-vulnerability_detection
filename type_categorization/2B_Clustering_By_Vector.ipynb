    "# Method 2:  Clustering by Vector\n",
    "The goal remains to group weaknesses/vulnerabilities by similarity.  In method 1, grouping definitions were extracted from the [CWE website's](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html), which contained a predefined hierarchical graph for CWE IDs.  Then, the tree was traversed to return a subset that contained the CWE IDs found in the original dataset (from the source code slices) and their overarching primary group listing.  This produced 15 groups that varied in size from 52 to 274,281.  For example, the source code contained 52 slices of code containing a potential CWE-398 weakness.  ['Code Quality' (CWE-398)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/700.html) is a top-level category according to the CWE website.  No other CWE-IDs were obtained from our slices that fell under the CWE-398's branch, and therefore Group #14 is named 'Code Quality' and has a size of 52.  On the other hand, 'Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime' (CWE-664) contained a majority of CWE-IDs (75 out of the 166 unique CWE-IDs in the source code slices) and sample counts, totaling 274,281 samples, which is approximately 66.3% of all the samples/groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, an attempt is made to group source code slices by converting them into vectors & clustering the vectors with a similarity distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the 420,627 slices, 1,369 slices contained deprecated or obsolete CWE-IDs and 5,286 slices obtained by CVEs did not have a CWE-ID associated with them.  Thus, a maximum of 413,972 slices should be used in the training model.\n"
